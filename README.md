# Equivalence-Testing-Presentation

This was an extra credit assignment I completed for my PSY610 data analysis class. It gave me a chance to experiment with RPresentation authoring, knitr, and git version control.

It also gave me a chance to explore the important statistical concept of equivalence testing, something that likely comes in handy for evaluating clinical studies inside and out of psychology.
