Hypothesis Testing In Practice
========================================================
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
```

- The goal of many clinical studies is to show that new drugs and therapies are either equivalent to, or better than, existing methods

- High stakes require high levels of confidence, hence rigorous statistical testing

- Recall:

$H _{0}: \mu= \overline {x}$

$H _{A}: \mu > \overline {x}$ ,   or,   $\mu < \overline {x}$ ,   or both

*In hypothesis testing, the goal is to disprove the null hypothesis*

Introducing Equivalence & Non-Inferiority
========================================================

*Which hypothesis carries the burden of proof?*
```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(TestType = c("Comparative", "Equivalence", "Non-inferiority"), NullHyp = c("No difference", "No Equivalence", "New is inferior to old"), AlternativeHyp = c("Difference", "New is equivalent to old", "New is not inferior to old")) %>%
  kable()
```

Slide With Plot
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
