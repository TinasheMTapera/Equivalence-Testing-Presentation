Hypothesis Testing In Practice
========================================================


- The goal of many clinical studies is to show that new drugs and therapies are either equivalent to, or better than, existing methods

- High stakes require high levels of confidence, hence rigorous statistical testing

- Recall:

$H _{0}: \mu= \overline {x}$

$H _{A}: \mu > \overline {x}$ ,   or,   $\mu < \overline {x}$ ,   or both

*In hypothesis testing, the goal is to disprove the null hypothesis*

Introducing Equivalence & Non-Inferiority
========================================================

*Which hypothesis carries the burden of proof?*

|TestType        |NullHyp                |AlternativeHyp             |
|:---------------|:----------------------|:--------------------------|
|Comparative     |No difference          |Difference                 |
|Equivalence     |No Equivalence         |New is equivalent to old   |
|Non-inferiority |New is inferior to old |New is not inferior to old |

Equivalence Explained
========================================================

By *equivalence*, we mean that:

"...the efficacies of the two therapies are close
enough so that one cannot be considered superior or inferior to
the other."

By *non-inferiority*, we mean that:

"...the efficacy of the new therapy is no more than $\delta$ units less than that of the current therapy (assuming higher is better)."

Walker and Nowacki (2010)

The Equivalence Margin
========================================================

The equivalence margin $\delta$ is a constant:

- Range of values to denote efficacies are "close enough"

- Maximum clinically acceptable difference

The Two One-Sided Test
======================================================

- Most common method of equivalence testing
- Equivalence is established for a given $\alpha$ if confidence interval for the difference in efficacies is within the $\delta$ interval
- Recall that confidence interval is a range of values related to $\alpha$ that estimates the margin of error

$(1-\alpha) \times 100\% CI$ for $\mu  =  \overline{x} \pm ME$
