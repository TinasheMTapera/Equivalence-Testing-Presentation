Hypothesis Testing In Practice
========================================================


- The goal of many clinical studies is to show that new drugs and therapies are either equivalent to, or better than, existing methods

- High stakes require high levels of confidence, hence rigorous statistical testing

- Recall:

$H _{0}: \mu= \overline {x}$

$H _{A}: \mu > \overline {x}$ ,   or,   $\mu < \overline {x}$ ,   or both

*In hypothesis testing, the goal is to disprove the null hypothesis*

Introducing Equivalence & Non-Inferiority
========================================================

*Which hypothesis carries the burden of proof?*

|TestType        |NullHyp                |AlternativeHyp             |
|:---------------|:----------------------|:--------------------------|
|Comparative     |No difference          |Difference                 |
|Equivalence     |No Equivalence         |New is equivalent to old   |
|Non-inferiority |New is inferior to old |New is not inferior to old |
